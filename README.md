# VIR Reports Repository

This repository contains Vulnerability Intelligence Reports (VIR) generated by the VIR MVP Flow automation system.

## Overview

The VIR MVP Flow is an automated toolchain that:
1. Monitors NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for new CVE publications
2. Enriches CVE data through AI-powered research
3. Generates comprehensive vulnerability intelligence reports
4. Publishes reports to this repository

## Repository Structure

```
vlab-vir-reports/
├── vir-reports/          # Generated VIR reports (JSON format)
├── processing-log/       # Daily processing logs
└── README.md            # This file
```

## VIR Report Format

Each VIR report is a JSON file containing:

- **Basic CVE Information**: ID, description, severity, CVSS scores
- **Enriched Data**: Additional research, threat intelligence, remediation guidance
- **Metadata**: Processing timestamps, enrichment model, data quality scores

### Example VIR Report Structure

```json
{
  "vir_id": "VIR-2024-XXXX",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-XXXX",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "published",
  "vulnerability": {
    "title": "Vulnerability Title",
    "description": "Detailed description",
    "severity": "HIGH",
    "cvss_score": 8.5
  },
  "enrichment": {
    "research_summary": "Additional research findings",
    "threat_landscape": "Current threat context",
    "remediation_guidance": "Recommended actions"
  }
}
```

## Automation Details

- **Monitoring Frequency**: Hourly checks for new CVEs
- **Enrichment**: AI-powered research and analysis
- **Publishing**: Automatic GitHub repository updates
- **Logging**: Daily processing logs with metrics
